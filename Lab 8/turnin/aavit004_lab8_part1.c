 *	Exercise Description: [optional - include for your own benefit]
 *		
 *	Using the ATmega1284â€™s PWM functionality, 
 *	design a system that uses three buttons to select one of three tones to be generated on the speaker. 
 *	When a button is pressed, the tone mapped to it is generated on the speaker. Criteria:
	Use the tones C4, D4, and E4 from the table in the introduction section.
	When a button is pressed and held, the tone mapped to it is generated on the speaker.
	When more than one button is pressed simultaneously, the speaker remains silent. 
	When no buttons are pressed, the speaker remains silent.

 *	code, is my own original work.
